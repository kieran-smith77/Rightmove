Located on this quiet tree lined road in the heart of Beauchief one of Sheffield&#39;s most sought after and desirable suburbs within catchment for top performing local schools, numerous amenities are a short stroll and don&#39;t forget The Peak District is on the door step.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>VALUER</strong> <strong></strong> Andy Robinson &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong></strong> <strong></strong> S8 Area Guide<br />Batemoor, Beauchief, Greenhill, Jordanthorpe, Lowedges, Meersbrook, Norton, Norton Lees, Woodseats<br /><br />The S8 postcode area covers the South part of the outskirts of Sheffield city centre down towards Dronfield. Covering a vast array of suburbs, the properties range from larger more expensive family homes in the Beauchief area to cosy more affordable homes in the Jordanthorpe, Norton area. This makes S8 a great place to look for your next property whether you want your family&#39;s forever home, or if you are just starting out on the property ladder. <br /><br />At the most southern part of S8, you will find Lowedges, Greenhill, Batemoor and Jordanthorpe. These areas are removed from the hustle and bustle of Sheffield City Centre and the University campuses. There are still plenty of local amenities and with Woodseats and Chesterfield Road only being a 10 minute bus ride away, so if you fancy something a bit more lively then you&#39;ve not far to go. These suburbs are close to the Dronfield bypass which leads to Chesterfield. If a daily commute is something you are committed to, then this part of S8 is conveniently placed with easy access to the M1. <br /><br />Greenhill Park situated in Lowedges offers a playground, a bowling green and a skate park. Lowedges Festival is held here on the second Sunday of August each year which demonstrates the community feel of the area. Sheffield Transport Sports Club on Greenhill Main Road offers football pitch hire, practice golf facilities, snooker hire and cricket pitch hire. Also, as you head up toward Norton you will find Graves Health and Sports Centre. Being newly refurbished in 2016 the facilities offer a swimming pool, gym, and various fitness and sports classes. <br /><br />S8 boasts plenty of green space. Not only is there the aforementioned Greenhill Park, but also Oakes Park, Norton Playing Fields and Meersbrook Park. Meersbrook Park has a playground, 2 bowling greens, a cricket wicket, tennis courts, basketball hoops, a skateboard park and also some woodland area. Graves Park has a playground, cricket pitches, a practice golf course, football pitches, bowling greens, tennis courts and a playground. There are plenty of open grassy areas plus woodland, streams and 3 small lakes. The Rose Garden Caf&eacute; is close to the playground and offers hot and cold food. What makes this park extra special for the little ones however, is Graves Park Animal Farm. Entry is free and here you can find rare farm breeds and smaller animals such as rabbits and guinea pigs. Along with all this parkland, S8 is home to a fair few allotments: Woodseats Allotments, Heeley and Meersbrook Allotments and Warminster Road Allotments. <br /><br />As with a lot of other areas of Sheffield, S8 offers a wonderful array of choice when it comes to eating out. From bistros, delis, Italians, Mexican, Caribbean and Indian, you can pretty much take your pick with any cuisine you fancy. That Place is voted number 6 on Trip Advisor for Restaurants in Sheffield. No mean feat considering that it is only open in the day between 9am and 3pm. It&#39;s speciality of a homemade scotch egg is something not to be missed. If you&#39;d rather be eating out in the evening then Viraaj might be a good choice if you fancy a curry. Winning Yorkshire Restaurant of the year in 2017 in the English Curry Awards this curry house is definitely worth a visit. For something a little bit special then Marco @ Milano is an excellent choice. Serving high end Italian food in a beautiful building, which used to be a police station! <br /><br />Chesterfield Road is a main arterial route into the city centre, therefore the transport links are very good with buses running frequently. Just off Chesterfield Road is Heeley Retail Park where you can find a Next Clearance, Pets at Home, Boots, Costa Coffee, Matalan and Currys. There are also many independent shops in the vicinity including Pondsfords, which is famous in Sheffield for its fine furniture. <br /><br />There are a huge choice of nurseries and pre-schools in the S8 area: <br />Beauchief Pre-School <br />Beechwood Day Nursery and Pre-School <br />Brierley Field Children&#39;s Nursery Ltd <br />Bright Horizons Day Nursery and Pre-School <br />Gresley Road

This is a wonderful area for a whole variety of reasons, one of which is its superb accessibility. Nether Edge enjoys excellent transport links via Abbeydale Road and Chesterfield Road (A61), giving you an easy trip into the city centre and beyond. This makes Sheldon Road a superb home for commuting professionals or anyone who wishes to explore the length and breadth of Sheffield. Nether Edge is also surrounded by a host of excellent local amenities, due in no small part to its enviable location in-between Abbeydale Road and Ecclesall Road. These famous thoroughfares are home to countless excellent businesses, ranging from high street shops and local artisans to delicious cafes and global eateries. This wealth of choice means you will never find yourself lacking in options when planning social occasions or simply treating yourself to a bit of luxury. Nearby green spaces include Meersbrook Park, Broadfield Park and, for the green fingered, the lovely Brincliffe Edge Allotments. Abbeydale Road also gives you access to the glorious Peak District, a route which leads directly to some truly impressive sights such as the magnificent Chatsworth House. <br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong></strong> <strong></strong> Step inside your new home:<br />You enter Sheldon Road through a long hallway with stairs leading up to the first floor and another set taking you down to the basement for storage use. To your left are two well sized rooms: the living room and the renovated kitchen. The living room is a substantial space with a number of period features to recommend is such as recovered original floorboards, broad alcoves and a high ceiling. A large bay window floods the space with natural light which, together with room for plenty of comfy seating, makes this great for relaxing with friends. The kitchen is a sleek refurbishment with ample storage, contemporary integrated appliances, and stylish design choices such as the exposed brickwork and low hanging lights. The elegant kitchen island doubles as a breakfast bar, turning cooking into a social experience as much as dining together. New French doors lead out to the patio garden, a well-sized environment with a slate courtyard and lots of room for outdoor dining furniture. With some care and attention, this has the potential to become a gorgeous space to enjoy summer days. Back inside, the former kitchen is tucked on the end of the ground floor. This space needs a full refurbishment but, with its generous dimensions, it would make an ideal utility or dining room. Upstairs you will find two large bedrooms, the family bathroom, and the former shower room. Bedrooms 2 will require attention to reach its potential but the vast bedroom 1 has been subject to some attractive renovations, with smart re-plastering and carpets giving you a lovely blank canvas to work with. The former shower room is unfinished but would make an ideal ensuite for bedroom 2. The new family bathroom boasts an immaculate three-piece suite with handy under-sink storage and a shower above the bath. Occupying the second floor are bedrooms 3 and 4, both doubles with plenty of potential for an ambitious homeowner to realise. <br />&nbsp;", "photos": ["https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_00_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_01_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_02_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_03_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_04_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_05_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_06_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_07_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_08_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_09_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_10_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_11_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_12_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/105k/104957/117721004/104957_103202005213_IMG_13_0000_max_620x414.jpeg"], "features": ["Popular Nether Edge Position", "Close to Abbeydale Road Amenities", "Brimming With Potential ", "Excellent Transport Links", "Generously Sized Rooms", "Four Double Bedrooms", "Sleek Renovated Kitchen & Full Bathroom", "Ideal Family Home", "Lots of Green Spaces Nearby", "On-Street Parking"], "review": "Good"}, "12": {"id": "117829136", "price": 275000.0, "bedrooms": 3, "address": "Glossop Road, Sheffield, South Yorkshire", "propertyType": "terraced house", "letFurnishType": null, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-117829136.html", "summary": "GUIDE PRICE \u00a3275,000 FOR SALE BY AUCTION on 25 JANUARY 2022 at  commencing at 09:00 prompt.

The guide price or range of guide prices is given to assist consumers in deciding whether or not to pursue a purchase.  It is usual, but not always the case, that a provisional reserve range is agreed between the seller and auctioneer at the start of marketing.  As the reserve is not fixed at this stage and can be adjusted by the seller at any time up to the day of the auction in the light of interest shown during the marketing period, a guide price is issued.  This guide price can be shown in the form of a minimum and maximum price range within which an acceptable sale price (reserve) would fall, or as a single price figure within 10% of which the minimum acceptable price (reserve) would fall.  A guide price is different to a reserve (see below).  Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.<br /><br /><br /><br />Reserve Price:  This is the seller&#39;s minimum acceptable price at auction and the figure below which the auctioneer cannot sell.  The reserve price is not disclosed and remains confidential between the seller and the auctioneer.  Both the guide price and the reserve price can be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.<br /><br /><strong>*Guide Price/Reserve Price</strong><br /><strong>Guide Price: </strong>An indication of a seller's minimum expectation at auction and given as a &#34Guide Price&#34 or a range of &#34Guide Prices&#34.
