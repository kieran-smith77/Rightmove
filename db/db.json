Abbeydale Road South leading into Abbeydale Road is one of the main arterial routes into Sheffield from the Peak District. Many of the houses on Abbeydale Road South and in Millhouses truly have a family feel about them. Ranging from large Victorian and Edwardian terraces to newer semi-detached houses, many of these homes are ideal for families. <br /><br />Nether Edge is another highly sought after area. Homes in this leafy area are always popular due to its proximity to Abbeydale Road and Ecclesall Road, yet still being far enough away to feel more quiet and relaxed. There are many imposing large Edwardian and Victorian townhouses here. Many of which have been split into large 2-3 bedroom apartments. <br /><br />Further towards Abbeydale from Nether Edge, you will find typical slightly smaller terraces. Many of these houses are popular with first time buyers and investors. Some students choose to live in this area of Sheffield due to its location close to the transport links of Abbeydale Road and its vibrant, friendly, multicultural feel. <br /><br />S7 has a varied choice of nurseries and schools located within its boundary, some Ofsted Outstanding. <br /><br />Nurseries<br />Bright Horizons Day Nursery and Pre-school<br />Crescent House Day Nursery<br />Croft Corner Forest School Nursery<br />Hamilton House Day Nursery<br />Sheffield Scallywags Nursery and Out of School Club<br />Sharrow School Childcare Services<br /><br />Schools<br />Brantwood Specialist School<br />Carterknowle Junior School<br />Dobcroft Infant School<br />Dobcroft Junior School<br />Holt House Infant School<br />Nether Edge Primary School<br />St Wilfreds RC Primary School<br /><br /><br />Millhouses Park on Abbeydale Road is one of the most popular parks in Sheffield. With a huge 32 acres to claim, it&#39;s no wonder that there&#39;s an abundance of activities available there. For the children there&#39;s an adventure playground which includes a zip wire and 2 skate parks. At the weekends and during half term there are also inflatable bouncy castles or slides which can be enjoyed for a fee. There&#39;s a water play park which is a real attraction when the weather turns warm. The boating lake has small boats and pedalos available to hire situated right next to the caf&eacute; which serves hot and cold food. There are also recently refurbished basketball courts, tennis courts and table tennis outdoor tables, a bowling green and a five-a-side pitch. Peppered around all these attractions are plenty of stretches of grass perfect for picnics and outdoor games. A full cricket pitch on the edge of the park is great if you enjoy watching the game as there are often teams participating in their full &#39;whites&#39;. <br /><br />At the other end of the S7 area, in Sharrow closer to the city centre, you will find another notable public park; Mount Pleasant Park. This park contains Highfield Adventure Playground which offers a tunnel slide, wild zip wire and water pumps in the outdoor play area. Not only this, but there is an indoor play area with a special indoor mezzanine floor. The playground is open in the afternoons and is free to use. <br /><br />Mount Pleasant Park is home to Sharrow Festival which has grown in size and popularity since it began in 1998. The festival showcases local talent and embraces the cultural diversity of the area. There are sporting activities, a live graffiti area and also entertainment for the children. <br /><br />As you head down Abbeydale Road towards the city centre, you head towards Sheffield&#39;s Antique Quarter. With numerous antique shops and reclaimed furniture stores it really is a treasure hunters dream. Along this part of Abbeydale Road there are also numerous restaurants, coffee shops and fast food establishments. With its hustle, bustle and multicultural feel it really has an inviting, warm and trendy feel to it. <br /><br />Abbeydale Picture House is smack in the middle of the Antiques Quarter and is the only cinema left of its era in Sheffield. Opened in 1920, it is now a Grade II listed building. Having luckily kept a lot of its original features, it really is an impressive and beautiful building. Now up and running as a cinema again, various events are held there and the rooms and studios are available to hire. <br /><br />It would seem that S7 is blessed with managing to maintain its interesting history. On Abbeydale Road South you can also find Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet and the 18th Century Works. This old industrial works has been restored and transformed following a 3 year &pound;1 million Heritage Lottery Funded project completed in 2016. It really is like stepping back in time, with various crafts and skills from the era demonstrated throughout the year. <br /><br />Whatever your culinary preference, you are certain to find something to satisfy you in S7. From artisan bread to Chinese, Thai, Italian, Spanish and Vietmanese there&#39;s something for everyone&#39;s tastebuds. Kia&#39;s Pastaria has been voted number 9 in the top 10 restaurants in Sheffield. Serving authentic Italian cuisine in a cosy and inviting atmosphere, it is easy to see why. Arusuvai serves South Indian and Sri Lankan dishes and Undal is a lovely Indian takeaway which also caters for parties. If pies and sausages are more your bag, then the Broadfield Ale House will most definitely not disappoint. Serving craft beers and homemade award winning pies and sausages, this child friendly pub and restaurant is always a popular choice. <br /><br />If you fancy being transported to a simpler and rather more indulgent time, then Jameson&#39;s Caf&eacute; and Tea Rooms is a perfect choice. Serving afternoon tea, sandwiches, cobbled eggs and wonderful brunch items by staff in Victorian serving attire, this quirky caf&eacute; is super quaint. What must also be mentioned is Jameson&#39;s cake tapas. For a cake lover, it&#39;s as amazing as it sounds! For lunch and brunch you really are spoiled for choice in S7. Whether you&#39;re running in to grab a bite to take away or whether you have the time to sit down and indulge, there are many cafes to choose from. Bragazzis is an Italian caf&eacute; complete with a barista, homemade cakes and sandwiches and paninis filled with the in house Italian deli&#39;s wonderful ware. The Forge Bakehouse, is an artisan bakery which also offers a restaurant where you can have their home baked goods served as brunch, lunch or an indulgent snack. If you would rather cook at home with your own produce, then S7 is also home to Brincliffe Edge allotments. <br />&nbsp;", "longitude": -1.4795454, "latitude": 53.366135, "floorplans": ["https://media.rightmove.co.uk/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_FLP_00_0000.jpeg"], "photos": ["https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_00_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_01_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_02_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_03_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_04_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_05_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_06_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_07_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_08_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_09_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_10_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_11_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_12_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_13_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_14_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_15_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_16_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_17_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_18_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_19_0000_max_620x414.jpeg", "https://media.rightmove.co.uk/dir/110k/109054/118372757/109054_100465010364_IMG_20_0000_max_620x414.jpeg"], "features": ["LARGE THREE DOUBLE BEDROOMED VICTORIAN TERRACED", "BAY WINDOWED AND DOUBLE REAR OFF SHOT", "SUPERB LOCATION IN ULTRA POPULAR NETHER EDGE", "AVAILABLE WITH NO ONWARD CHAIN", "CONTEMPORARY FINISH AND ORIGINAL FEATURES", "PERFECT FOR THE FIRST TIME BUYER OR YOUNG FAMILY ALIKE", "SHORT STROLL TO FASHIONABLE ABBEYDALE AND LONDON ROADS", "SUPER DECEPTIVE WITH VIEWING ESSENTIAL TO DO FULL JUSTICE", "EASY ACCESS TO BOTH CENTRAL SHEFFIELD AND THE PEAK DISTRICT", "THREE SPACIOUS FLOORS OF ACCOMMODATION"], "review": "Good"}, "2": {"id": "117218399", "price": 325000.0, "bedrooms": 3, "address": "Ranby Road, Sheffield, S11", "propertyType": "terraced house", "letFurnishType": null, "url": "https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-117218399.html", "fullDescription": "A fabulous larger style three double bedroom period terrace house situated on this very sought after tree lined road, close to Endcliffe Park.
